Answers to Exercise Questions
-----------------------------
Q1: I first looked at functions with the word "time" in them, and found DoTimer() (0x01002fe0), 
I changed the jz short locret_1003007 to  jmp     short locret_1003007 so the function wont do anything.
The timer then still jumped to 1, so I looked for inc _cSec, and found it at 0x0100382A, and changed the inc and the call to PlayTune to NOPS.
Q2: I found the SetTimer command in the documentation, found it in the code (0x0100384F) and changed the timeout param from 1000ms to 500ms.(0x0100383D)
Q3:
changed where the timer is increased to decrease instead.(0x01002FF5 DoTimer ,0x01003830 ButtonDown)

before these DEC calls there were checks to compare the timer to 0 and 999 (0 in ButtonDown to initiate the timer 0x01003821, and 999 in DoTimer to stop counting 0x01002FE9)
these were changed to jumps to my new code (ButtonDown jumps to 0x01004a60, DoTimer jumps to 0x01004A7F) which is explained below.

01004A60      833D 9C570001 00      CMP DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],0             ; from ButtonDown if timer is 0 (game hasnt started) set the timer to 121 (will be decreased by 1 and displayed as 120)
01004A67      75 11                 JNE SHORT 01004A7A
01004A69      C705 9C570001 7900000 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],79            ; set _cSec to 121
01004A73      833D 9C570001 79      CMP DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],79            ; compare to 121 so the jump wont be taken
01004A7A    ^ E9 A7EDFFFF           JMP 01003826                             ; go back to the ButtonDown
01004A7F      833D 9C570001 00      CMP DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],0             ; from DoTimer (if timer reaches 0, call GameOver(False), otherwise, return normaly)
01004A86      75 13                 JNE SHORT 01004A9B                       ; if not 0 jump
01004A88      6A 00                 PUSH 0                                   ; false - if timer = 0 call GameOver(False) = Loss
01004A8A      E8 EDE9FFFF           CALL 0100347C                            ; GameOver(false) = loss
01004A8F      833D 9C570001 00      CMP DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],0             ; Compare _cSec to 0 and reutrn to DoTimer for normal flow
01004A96    ^ E9 56E5FFFF           JMP 01002FF1
01004A9B    ^ E9 55E5FFFF           JMP 01002FF5                             ; jump to the Decrease Timer
